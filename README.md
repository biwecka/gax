# XHSTT Genetic Algorithm

## XHSTT Problem Instances
Timetabling problems in the XHSTT XML format can be downloaded
[here](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dmmp/hstt/archives/).

Files are available as collections (containing multiple problem instances)
and as single-instance files. Currently, single-instance files are preferred,
as they also come with the known solutions.

To get started with implementing a scheduler, the artificial problem instances
have been chosen, so it's not needed to implement a whole lot of constraints.
